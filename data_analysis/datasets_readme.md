# Our own databases

In addition to the above simple datasets, we work with the below databases (and tables thereof) in real time projects. We use real data to show how the tough challenges in production scale databases 

- An ecommerce database, that is the backend of a fictitious retail store that has been in production since 7 years and we will use all the data that got generated by people all over the world
- Opencats database that contains candidates, jobs, companies, contacts, activity etc.
